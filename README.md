# Microservice Blueprint: Go Monorepo with Hot-Reload

This project serves as a comprehensive and robust blueprint for developing modern microservices using Go, managed within a monorepo structure. It is designed for fast, containerized development using **Podman/Docker** and features **Hot-Reload** capabilities via `air`, ensuring a highly efficient development loop right from the start.

# Key Features

- Monorepo Structure: Centralized repository for multiple independent services (service-a, service-b) and shared libraries (shared/go).

- Isolated Dependency Management: Uses Go's module replace directives to link services to the internal shared library without requiring external publishing.

- Containerized Development: Utilizes podman-compose (compatible with docker-compose) for environment consistency and simplified dependency handling.

- Instant Hot-Reload (air): Changes in service files or the shared library automatically trigger a recompile and restart within the container, saving valuable development time.

- Clean Build Workflow: All common tasks (setup, dev, test, production builds) are automated through the Makefile.

- Robust Development Setup: Non-destructive Dockerfile commands ensure that local go.mod files are protected from container-level modifications.
